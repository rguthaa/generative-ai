# 🧠 Generative AI: Prompt Architectures, Patterns & Projects

## 👋 Welcome

I'm a senior software professional with 19+ years of experience, currently focused on exploring and applying **prompt engineering strategies and architectures** in Generative AI systems.

This repository is my **personal learning lab** — it captures hands-on exploration of **prompt patterns**, **LLM behavior**, and how to build structured, explainable AI workflows using models like GPT-4, Claude, and open-source LLMs.

## 📚 What's in this Repo?

### `01_prompt_library/`
A structured, pattern-based library of prompts — designed for clarity, reuse, and systematization.

🔍 **Prompt Patterns Categorized Into:**
- 📘 *Instruction-Based*: Task-only, context-aware, constraint-driven
- 👥 *Contextual & Role-Based*: Personas, audiences, perspectives
- 🧠 *Reasoning-Driven*: CoT, ToT, Self-reflection, Critique
- 📊 *Output-Format Driven*: JSON, tables, templates
- 🎯 *Example-Driven*: Few-shot, Zero-shot, Option prompts
- 🧩 *Advanced / Hybrid*: RAG, Multi-modal, Agent-style prompting

💡 Each file contains:
- Pattern overview
- Prompt structure with rationale
- Sample inputs/outputs
- Model behavior insights
- When to use / avoid

📄 See [`01_prompt_library/README.md`](01_prompt_library/README.md) for the full categorized breakdown.

### `02_projects/`
Real-world mini-projects and LLM workflows showcasing pattern usage:

- 🤖 **RAG-based Chatbot**: Combines retrieval + prompting
- 🧺 **AI Agent Planner**: Multi-step reasoning and goal tracking
- 🧪 **Prompt Tuner for Output Testing**: Evaluate JSON generation using patterns

Each project includes:
- Pattern(s) used
- Prompt evolution
- Output samples
- Technical stack (LangChain, OpenAI, etc.)

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

- 🧱 Build a reusable library of **prompt patterns and modules**
- 🧪 Test different **LLM architectures and control strategies**
- 🧑‍🏫 Use this material for **future workshops and hands-on training**
- 🤝 Collaborate with others who are exploring prompt design
