# 🧠 Generative AI: Personal Learning & Experiments

## 👋 Welcome

I'm a senior software professional with 20+ years of experience. This repository is my personal space to explore and experiment with **Generative AI**, particularly in the areas of:

- Prompt Engineering
- LLM-powered Applications
- LangChain Workflows
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agents and Automation

These hands-on projects and prompt libraries are part of my continuous learning journey in emerging AI technologies.
