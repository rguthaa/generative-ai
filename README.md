# üß† Generative AI: Prompt Patterns & Architectures

## üëã Welcome

I'm a senior software professional with 20+ years of experience in software engineering. This repository is my personal exploration space into **Generative AI**, with a focus on designing and experimenting with **prompt architectures and reusable prompt patterns**.

This work reflects my ongoing learning in applying structured, modular, and scalable prompting strategies using LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and open-source models via LangChain.
